# The CIA Data Vis Project

The CIA created the World Factbook as a classified document in 1962. They released it to the public in 1971, and it's now one of the leading sources of statistics on each of the world's 195 sovereign nations and 59 dependent territories. This website is a visualization of that data.

I made this site as a project for the Advanced Interactive Multimedia class at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I built the front end with Angular and D3, and used Node and Express for the backend.
